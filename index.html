            <h2>Biography</h2>
            <p>
                Subhas Chandra Bose, fondly known as Netaji, was one of the most prominent and charismatic leaders of the Indian freedom struggle. Born on January 23, 1897, in Cuttack, Orissa, he grew up to become an iconic figure who left an indelible mark on the history of India's fight for independence.Netaji's early education took place in India, but he later traveled to England in pursuit of higher studies. He appeared for the Indian Civil Service (ICS) examination but, influenced by the nationalist movement, decided to dedicate his life to India's freedom struggle instead. This decision marked the beginning of his remarkable journey as a freedom fighter.One of the key chapters in Netaji's life was his association with Mahatma Gandhi and the Indian National Congress. He actively participated in the non-cooperation movement launched by Gandhi and quickly rose through the ranks of the Congress due to his exceptional leadership skills. However, philosophical differences with Gandhi led him to resign from prominent positions within the Congress, and he embarked on a journey that would redefine his role in the freedom movement.In 1941, during World War II, Netaji sought international support for India's independence. He traveled extensively, garnering support from countries like Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan. In 1942, he established the Indian National Army (INA) with the help of Japanese forces. The INA aimed to free India from British colonial rule through armed struggle. Netaji's famous slogan, "Give me blood, and I shall give you freedom," echoed the determination of his cause.Netaji's leadership of the INA and his audacious actions in Southeast Asia created a sense of urgency in the fight for independence. Unfortunately, the war's end and the ensuing events resulted in the dissolution of the INA and his capture by the British.Netaji's mysterious disappearance in 1945 remains a subject of debate and intrigue. While the official version suggests that he died in an air crash in Taiwan, various theories and conspiracy theories surrounding his death have persisted. The mystery surrounding Netaji's death has only added to his legendary status.
